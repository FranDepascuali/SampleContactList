Notes: 
1. It looks a little bit laggy because it's a gif. 
2. No loading indicator was added (nor error reporting) because a matter of time, I can add it but I think this already shows the coding skills
3. No tests were added, any `viewModel` is testable because they receive the dependencies via constructor injection
4. No design was provided, and my design skills are awful, so I'm just showing the info.
